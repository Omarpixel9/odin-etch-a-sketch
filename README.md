# Etch-A-Sketch - The Odin Project

This project was created by me for The Odin Project's Web Development 101 Course.

All code has been completely written by me.

## Objective

To create a web application that is somewhere between an Etch-A-Sketch and a Sketchpad. 

This should be a good project in order to practice my DOM manipulation skills.

## Requirements

- Web page with 16x16 grid (start with this as default)
  - Divs for grid must be created through JavaScript
  - Grids need to have a "hover" effect so that the divs change color, like using a trailing pen
- Add "clear grid" button
- Add "set grid size" button, which allows to set the number of squares inside the grid. The width of the grid needs to be the same as before.
  - Set a maximum size for the user (100x100 size)

### Optional

- Instead of just black and white, you can play around with colors for the divs inside the grid
